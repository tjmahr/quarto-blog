This is the **not** first post in a Quarto blog. Welcome!

Since this post doesn't specify an explicit `image`, the first image in the post will be used in the listing page of posts. 

Okay!

I want a banner image on top like the old site with a credit to the source.

I had to put `fig-width: 8` under `format > html` in `_quarto.yml`. I also pushed other knitr options here: 

```
    fig-asp: 0.618
    fig-dpi: 300
    fig-align: "center"
    fig-cap-location: "margin"
```

I got to opt into `fig-cap-location: "margin"`.

I had to remove the old knitr _cached stuff. Still need a different solution.

I don't want the green links. If I set the link color, that still leaves the green 
link color in the table of contents.

All of my old manual downlit attempts are styled differently than actual downlit urls.

I want a slightly larger font size.

I want underlined downlit links.

I have to convert fig.alt and fig.cap to here.

```
#| fig-alt: "Examples of `plot_dist()`"
#| fig-cap:
```
